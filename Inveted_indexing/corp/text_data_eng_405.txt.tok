I am happy to be a participant in today’s function.
It brings together eminent personalities from all walks of life united in their admiration and friendship for Vepa Shyam Rao, known to the world as Swami Agnivesh.
We have gathered here today to felicitate him on his 70th birthday and recall his diverse contributions - from emancipation and rehabilitation of bonded labourers across the country, to his fearless campaign against untouchability and for women’s rights, to his fight against communalism and religious intolerance.
His life testifies to the congruence and synergy between the principles underpinning our Constitution and the spiritual and moral principles of all religions.
I wish him many more years of service to the oppressed and the depressed masses in our society.
Friends The book edited by Shri Rajesh Chakrabarti could have been titled “The Real India”, instead of “The Other India”.
Its contributors collectively embody a vast span of knowledge and experience.
They project one overarching theme: that committed social activism leads to better public policy and programme implementation.
Allow me to mention a few of these: Claude Alvares cites Vinoba Bhave’s encounter with the first Planning Commission and quotes him as saying that “work for all and bread for all had to be the fundamental principle and goal of any planning”.
Today, we find that civil society’s efforts in this regard have culminated in the enactment of NREGA and moves towards enacting legislation on the Right to Food.
Asghar Ali Engineer and Claude Alvares recount how Gandhiji’s idea of Nai Talim, brought out together with Zakir Husain, has remained unimplemented and never taken seriously.
Probably the time has come to revisit Nai Talim as we look at the other aspects of educational reform.
Prof. M.G.K.
Menon quotes JRD Tata’s remark at a felicitation function after he was awarded Bharat Ratna in 1992.
He said: “I don’t want India to be an economic super power.
I want India to be a happy country.”  Prof. Menon concludes that in addition to inclusive sustainable development it is also essential to restrict consumption, keeping in view inter-generational equity.
As our GDP growth rates improve and levels of income and prosperity rise, we need to address the basic question: What is it that would make us happy?
Rev.
Valson Thampu makes a profound argument that the prime focus and shaping purpose of true religion is not God but man.
To him, the yardstick for measuring the robustness in a society is the plight of the powerless and the poorest.
It is no coincidence that social justice has energised the developmental imperative because it seeks to make it more inclusive.
Ashish Nandy’s analysis of global anguish and anxiety makes for interesting reading.
It is a telling statement that over a hundred thousand Pathans led by Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan were Khudai Khidmatgars during the Satyagraha Movement who endured colonial atrocities in their commitment to non-violence.
The role of the Pathans during the last two decades could not have been more different or contrasting.
The difference can only be explained by leadership.
Vandana Shiva has posited an alternative world view of an earth democracy encompassing “all life, not just humans, and definitely not just human privileged through class, race, gender and religion”.
She makes a compelling case for globalising compassion and peace.
Medha Patkar analyses how our natural resources, especially land and water, have been the theatre of conflict and strife.
She questions the meaning of ‘public purpose’ for acquisition of such resources and seeks a non-destructive, non-displacing and decentralised alternative.
Ladies and Gentlemen Facing ethical dilemmas is part of the process of living.
Great personalities and towering leaders emerge when they respond meaningfully to these dilemmas.
Harsh Mander mentions one such dilemma and how he addressed it in his professional life.
He found the answer in the letter and the spirit of our Constitution.
I think that this is a message that should reach out to a wider audience.
I felicitate Swami Agnivesh ji and thank the Sarva Dharma Sansad for inviting me today.
